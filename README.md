# IGNITE
Think Thirdweb, but Solana native, degen ready

## Getting Started

This repository contains a simple full stack example for interacting with the Solana blockchain.

### Backend

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend exposes endpoints for airdropping test SOL and transferring SOL from a server wallet.

### Frontend

Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser with a Solana wallet extension (such as Phantom) installed.

Use the buttons to connect your wallet, request an airdrop on devnet, and transfer SOL.

This is a minimal starting point inspired by thirdweb, specifically targeting the Solana blockchain.
